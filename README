CHEEKY MONKEY
=============
A game for the VIC20

(c) Gurce Isikyildiz 2020

Description
-----------
Guide your cheeky monkey to the top of the food-chain by throwing coconuts at all the other cheeky monkeys that stand in your way!

You can throw your coconuts in one of three possible directions:
- to the left
- upwards
- to the right

Note that by throwing a coconut upwards, beware that gravity will eventually bring the coconut hurtling back to the ground, so be sure to move out of the way before it lands!

Coconuts also rebound from the left & right edges of the screen. On occasions, this may prove helpful, or harmful :)

Your cheeky monkey is a fairly resilient fellow thankfully, capable withstanding 3 coconut knocks to the head before medical attention will be needed, and that will lead to the end of the game.

Controls
--------
This game makes use of the VIC20 Joystick port.

Left & Right = Move monkey left & right
   Up & Down = Monkey climbs up & down the ladder
        Fire = Throw coconut up
 Left + Fire = Throw coconut to the left
Right + Fire = Throw coconut to the right 

Compilation
-----------
I made use of the xa65 compiler, source-code available here:
- http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/

I was able to compile under both MacOSX and MinGW in Windows (with a few tweaks needed to the Makefile)

My Ramblings
------------
This has been my first 100% assembly game. Prior to this, I had dabbled in assembly, written small helper routines that were called from BASIC. So I enjoyed the challenge of getting more comfortable with expressing game-play via assembly.

As for what influenced me, I just wanted to create something simple and cute. I had a simple idea in my head: hey, maybe it'd be nice to have a game where monkeys throw coconuts at each other.

I'm fairly time-poor, with work and a 2 year old daughter keeping me fairly busy. So my decision to write a game for the VIC20 with no RAM expansion was very intentional, to force the scope of development to be small-scale and not let development time get too out of hand :)

I wanted to draw simple/cute 16x16 pixel artwork for it via paintbrush. I wanted to document the development journey in short spurts via posts to theC64 facebook forum too:
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/209280506324242

My hope in doing so was to help continue promoting the existence of the competition, with an additional hope of inspiring or motivating others to join in the competition too. I had hoped that if others could see how I tackled the task in small incremental chunks, that if they had a simple idea of their own that they wanted to bring to life, they could tackle it in a similar fashion too.

I'll share the source-code on github, in-case others might want to inspect and explore, though if others have plans to make use of it in their own projects in some way, it'd be nice if I were asked, or some credit/acknowledgement given ;)

Apart from that, no worries :)
